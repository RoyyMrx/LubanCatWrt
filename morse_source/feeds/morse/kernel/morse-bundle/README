This package contains a number of configuration defaults and scripts
used by the MorseMicro EVKs. It is a bit of a non-kosher package to
centralise sometimes necessarily deployed components which don't yet
have a formal home.

Many improvements will likely be made. These could include:
1 - bundling scripts into packages which they more closely relate. eg, 
    chipreset.sh should be bundled with the mm61xx package.
2 - uci default scripts, where possible, moved into board configuration
    scripts in the OpenWrt target folder
3 - Deploying platform specific network configuration (files/etc/config/*)
    into the same target folder, instead of deploying within this package.

An extra point to note, some configurations here may be changed by other
packages. For example, our RD05 router dongle contains another set of UCI
defaults to reconfigure the default state as bridged, dhcp client.
